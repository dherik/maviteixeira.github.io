My name is Marco Teixeira and I am a Java developer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Blogging is a new experience to me and seens a good way to give something back to the software community.

I will do my best to write a new article every 15 days or once a month, the topics may have a wide range from life itself to OOP. I usually like to discuss architecture, tests and way to keep your code maintainable.

I really hope you enjoy and feel free to comment with yout ideas.
