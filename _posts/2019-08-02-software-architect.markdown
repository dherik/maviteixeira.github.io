When working in software projects is hard to get some standards between different applications and teams, whether it is the same language or not, it obvious that in a serious organization you need to have some base standards, code quality bar and measurements. This applies, of course, to the projects internal communication, especially if it breaks the boundaries of different teams.

The question is how can we achieve that if no one is taking responsibility for this issues ? Each project have different problems, requirements and we need someone to address and take care of the big picture, this is the architect job.

**"A software architect is a software developer expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms. (Wikipedia)"**

However, this is not what the most companies think. Today most of the teams are self managed receiving some level of autonomy and responsability, this sounds great but created a myth that the architect is something unecessary and all decisions should be solved democratically even between different teams, they just have to talk to each other and vote.

Needless to say that every team have their own desires and preferences, going further I could say that each developer have his own agenda related to code standards and quality. This means, basically, that a biggest company you have more problems in the long run, because there is no one responsible to watch over the projects.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that the architect should be far from the teams just sending orders and enforcing rules to be followed, I do think the opposite, The architect should stay close to the teams, discuss with them, hear them out and take their opinion into consideration before make a decision and he must actively write code.

All this decision power comes with great responsibility, he needs to watch over the projects, ensure everything is on the right track and in the end of the day you have someone to demand results, metrics and quality.

You may argue that your team or company don't have an architect and everything is doing great, but don't be mistaken, one sure thing is it always be an architect, for better or worse a developer will assume this role and start to give the cards convincing people and make decisions without the full responsibility of the role.

Another downside and one of the biggest problems with this approach is the employer do not choose who will get the stick and in the most cases the best speaker or the most aggressive developer will assume the role without taking experience and technical skills in consideration.

To summarise, don't fall in the team democracy trap, every developer have their own interest in the project and you really need an experienced architect to make the right calls, enforce standards and quality gateways especially if you are not a small company. You must have someone to watch over the teams and ensure that your product is in the right shape for the market, so in the long run you don't need to expend thousands of dolars to writing all the software again.
