Just to get everyone up to speed I would like to quote what a software architect is supposed to do:
"A software architect is a software developer expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms."
Second Wikipedia an architect will make tough decisions and dictates a lot of things that will directly impact the developers but one thing that I want to add in this definition is: "The architect should take full responsiblity for the decisions made and report how things are running to the manager".

In this things I mean bugs per iteraction, quality related numbers (this may vary) and other data that the manager could eventually ask about the projects.

So by definition the architect role seems very important one if you ask me but despite of that most developers don't like it very much, to undertand this behavior we should look how the architect conducted his jobs some years ago. The old style architect usually follow one simple line: A experienced developer that know a lot about the company projects, get promoted and start to make all decisions about code in his office far from the team and without proper discussions.

The rise of agile methodologies and this distance between the architect and the team created a myth that the architect is something unecessary and self managed teams could fill that gap easily, we will enter in this discussion in a second.

First of all I agree that an architect that don't work with the teams, hear the opinions could not make the best call for the project and the company. Furthermore the architect should be actively coding because software related tecnology move fast and we need someonce to stay up to date to make critical decisions.

If you don't have this role in your company someone eventually will assume the role, this could be the most capable person or the bulliest one. So is better to think carefully and may be a better alternative give a splicity role to the former.





- How an architect is important
        --Who needs a software architect paper
        --Software architect is a fancy name for a expensive developer
        --Architecture is hard to change (caracteristic)
        All architecture is design but not all design is architecture
        Think about BDUF
        ---Historical definition (Durability, Utility, Beauty)
        How the system is partition and the interaction
        As the system grows the design and system specifications become more significant issues thant the choice of algoritm
        Descriptions of elements and interaction between then
        Govern the components and connections and relation between projects not the details
        You always have an architect, could be the biggest bully or the most capability person
        Walking skeleton with incremental architecture
        Everyone should be involved but onw must assume the responsability
        As an architect you need to help everyone to do architecture, you are a facilitator and responsible
        Create, share, critique / Adding gality gateways to prevent know issues (Checkstyle, PDM and Spotbugs)
        Choose somebody to have an architect autority to make decisions
        A myth of no need to software on agile teams
