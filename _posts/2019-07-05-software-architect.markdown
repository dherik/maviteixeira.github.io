Just to get everyone up to speed I would like to quote what a software architect is supposed to do:
"A software architect is a software developer expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms."
Second Wikipedia an architect will make tough design choices and dictates a lot of things but one thing that I want to add in this definition is: "The architect should take full responsiblity for the decisions and report how things are running to the manager".

In this things I mean bugs per iteraction, quality related numbers (this may vary).

This seems a very important role if you ask me, but why most of the developers don't like architects very much ?

The old style architect usually follow this line: A experienced developer that know a lot about the company projects and code make all decisions in his office very far from the team and without proper discussion about tecnology.

This distant approach and the rise of agile methodologies created a myth that the architect is something unecessary in self managed agile teams.



First of all I agree that an architect that don't code anymore and stays on silos very far from the teams is not a great choice, that alone should not invalidate the role itself but open room for improvement.

One thing that I know for sure is someone will assume the architect role in the team, this could be the most capable person or the bulliest one that will pressure the entire team to bow his decisions. So is better to give the responsability to the former.





- How an architect is important
        Who needs a software architect paper
        Software architect is a fancy name for a expensive developer
        Architecture is hard to change (caracteristic)
        All architecture is design but not all design is architecture
        Think about BDUF
        Historical definition (Durability, Utility, Beauty)
        How the system is partition and the interaction
        As the system grows the design and system specifications become more significant issues thant the choice of algoritm
        Descriptions of elements and interaction between then
        Govern the components and connections and relation between projects not the details
        You always have an architect, could be the biggest bully or the most capability person
        Walking skeleton with incremental architecture
        Everyone should be involved but onw must assume the responsability
        As an architect you need to help everyone to do architecture, you are a facilitator and responsible
        Create, share, critique / Adding gality gateways to prevent know issues (Checkstyle, PDM and Spotbugs)
        Choose somebody to have an architect autority to make decisions
        A myth of no need to software on agile teams
