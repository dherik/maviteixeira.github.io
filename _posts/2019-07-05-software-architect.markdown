## What is a software architect ?

Just to get everyone up to speed I would like to quote a software architect definition:
"A software architect is a software developer expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms."
It's clear that the role have a lot of responsabilities that impact directly the work of the team and the developers, but why such important professional is usually not praised in the most companies.

I my humble opinion 2 key factors did a big contribution for this grudge against the architect role and you might already know them, but to make everything clear here is what I think and why:

## How the architect is born and do his job
The first key factor is that in most traditional companies the architect usually is born following one simple rule: A experienced developer that have deep knowledge about the company projects get promoted to receive a raise and prevent him to leave, this alone not represent a big issue if the developer is well prepared for the new role but usually after this promotion most of the new architects leave the teams and start to work from very far from the code making all decisions about it in his office not doing proper discussion with developers.

## Rise of Agile
The second factor is the rise of agile methodologies and self managed teams. I don't have anything against both of them but self managed team created a myth inside companies that the architect is something unecessary and the teams could fill the architecture gap easily.

## The absence of architect
I do think the teams should have autonomy to make some decisions and responsibility for such but I will discuss that in another post, for now let's focus in the duties of a agile architect.

## Architect in agile
The architects should be very experienced developers and in the higher level needs to take care of the communication between projects and integrations if it will use http, events, database or even texts, know the trade offs and the better approach for the specific context. Where the company is heading so he could adapt the tecnology and tooles for future needs.
He needs to check PRs contantly and create quality gateways to ensure all the standards are being followed, I also think he should work close to the teams, listen and discuss with them all architecture and quality but in the end of the day the architect should have full autority and responsiblity to make the final decision.

## There is always an architect
One sure thing is it always be an architect in the team, being you happy or not. One developer will emerge and assume that role, this could be the most capable person in the team or the bulliest one. The problem with this is you will no choose which and even if the developer is very good it might not know the company plans or how the other projects should communicate and you will endup with a lot of heros inside many teams. He could even face the responsiblity of his decision but in the end he could just walk away from that role and can never be charge of it.

## Conclusion

Just to wrap eveything up we really need explicity architects to take care of project integrations, make sure the standards are being followed, the quality is respected and everything is on track with the company objectives. We need architects to take the entire responsibility for this problems and report the progress and issues, help the team to code better and code to help the team.
It's not the market standards right now and unfortunatelly I'm seeing a lot of problemas because of that and thousand of dollars going to waste.
