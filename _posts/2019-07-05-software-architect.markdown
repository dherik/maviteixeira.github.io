## What is a software architect ?

Just to get everyone up to speed I would like to quote a software architect definition:
"A software architect is a software developer expert who makes high-level design choices and dictates technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms."
It's clear that the role have a lot of responsabilities that impact directly the work of the team and the developers, but why such important professional is usually not praised in the most companies.

I my opinion 2 key factors did a big contribution for this grudge and you might already know them, but to make everything clear here is what I think and why:

## How the architect is born and do his job
The first key factor is that in most traditional companies the architect usually is born following one simple rule: A experienced developer that have deep knowledge about the company projects get promoted to receive a raise and prevent him to leave, this alone not represent a big issue if the developer is well prepared for the role but after this promotion most of the time the new architect leave the teams and start to work alone or with others architects making all decisions about code in his office far from the developers and without proper discussions.

## Rise of Agile
The second factor is the rise of agile methodologies and self managed teams. I don't have anything against both of them but the self managed team created a myth that the architect is something unecessary and the teams could fill the architecture gap easily.

## The absence of architect





## Architect in agile

## There is always an architect

## Conclusion







Second Wikipedia an architect will make tough decisions and dictates a lot of choices that will directly impact the developers, one thing that I would like to add in this definition is: "The architect should take full responsiblity for the decisions made and report metrics about quality, bugs to the manager".





So by definition the architect role seems very important if you ask me but despite of that most developers usually have some problem with this kind of authority don't like it very much, to undertand this behavior we should look how the architect conducted his jobs some years ago. The old style architect usually follow one simple line: A experienced developer that know a lot about the company projects, get promoted and start to make all decisions about code in his office far from the team and without proper discussions.

//Need to join
The rise of agile methodologies, this distance between the architect and the team created a myth that the architect is something unecessary and self managed teams could fill that gap easily, we will enter in this discussion in a second.

First I need to make clear that I agree that an architect whom don't work with the teams and hear their opinions will not make the best call for the project and the company. Furthermore the architect should be actively coding because software related tecnology move fast and we need someonce to stay up to date to make critical decisions.

One sure thing is if you don't have this role explicity in your company someone eventually will assume it, this could be the most capable person or the bulliest. So is better to think carefully and may be a better alternative give a explicity role to the former.





- How an architect is important
        --Who needs a software architect paper
        --Software architect is a fancy name for a expensive developer
        --Architecture is hard to change (caracteristic)
        All architecture is design but not all design is architecture
        Think about BDUF
        ---Historical definition (Durability, Utility, Beauty)
        How the system is partition and the interaction
        As the system grows the design and system specifications become more significant issues thant the choice of algoritm
        Descriptions of elements and interaction between then
        Govern the components and connections and relation between projects not the details
        --You always have an architect, could be the biggest bully or the most capability person
        Walking skeleton with incremental architecture
        Everyone should be involved but one must assume the responsability
        As an architect you need to help everyone to do architecture, you are a facilitator and responsible
        Create, share, critique / Adding gality gateways to prevent know issues (Checkstyle, PDM and Spotbugs)
        Choose somebody to have an architect autority to make decisions
        --A myth of no need to software on agile teams
